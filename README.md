## <a id="description-header"></a> Description

CRUD is an absolutely essential aspect of web-development. To better learn and master CRUD HTML methods - namely, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE - a Note Talker with broken code was refactored and made fully-functional.

The purpose of this Note Taker is essentially that of a simple to-do-list. A user can create, retrieve, and delete notes.
